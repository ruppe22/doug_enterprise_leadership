# AI Shopping Is Here. Your Catalog Supply Chain Is the Constraint

- AI shopping is no longer another feature on your roadmap. It is a new buying surface.

  A customer can ask an assistant to find the best option, compare tradeoffs, and complete checkout without ever opening your site. That changes how products get discovered and how buying decisions get made.

  The winners will not be the loudest AI adopters.

  They will be the organizations that can publish consistent, machine-readable commerce truth at scale, across every system that touches the buying decision.

  ## **Channels to decision loops**

  Most e-commerce optimization still assumes this:

  - A human browses a site or app
  - We influence behavior through UX, promotions, and media
  - The conversion funnel is mostly owned, or at least observable, sessions

  Agent-led buying works differently:

  - An agent handles discovery, comparison, and sometimes checkout
  - The agent relies on structured facts, not your page design
  - Trust is assigned to the most consistent sources of truth, not the most persuasive creative

  A simple way to think about it:

  - **Intent:** what the customer asks for
  - **Retrieval:** what the agent can pull from structured data
  - **Matching and ranking:** how the options are compared
